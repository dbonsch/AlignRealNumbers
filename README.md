# AlignRealNumbers
Experiment how to align real number without having a gap.

It's not a perfect allignment of all real numbers.
Endless sequences have no defined position.

However there is no gap in the listing where you could point at like: it should be located between X and Y.

Every subset of PI eg. has a defined position in this list.  Position for: 3.1415 is: 153584 and so on...
I'm not sure whether the index of PI is undefined or just beyond infinty.
